### RDM
A light and simple tool - accessible from the menu bar - that not only lets you use MacBook Pro's Retina highest and unsupported resolutions but also changes your screen resolution independent of your monitor.  
It basically allows you to access the brute GPU output resolution, independent of your monitor. The holy grail of high-res screen capturing!  

As an example, a Retina MacBook Pro 13" can be set to 3360×2100 maximum resolution, as opposed to Apple's max supported 1680×1050.

Compatible with Apple Silicon.  
Since 2023 I decided to host the RDM 2.2 installer as it fades away from online. [Download](https://github.com/olgv/help-out/blob/main/macOS/RDM/RDM-2.2.dmg)
