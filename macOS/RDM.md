### RDM
A light and simple tool that not only lets you use MacBook Pro Retina's highest and unsupported resolutions but also changes your screen resolution independent of your monitor. The holy grail of screen capturing!<br>
As an example, a Retina MacBook Pro 13" can be set to 3360×2100 maximum resolution, as opposed to Apple's max supported 1680×1050. It is accessible from the menu bar.<br>
